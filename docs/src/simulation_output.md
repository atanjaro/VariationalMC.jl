# Simulation Output Overview

In this section we define and provide an overview of the output generated by a
VMC simulation performed using the [VariationalMC.jl](https://github.com/atanjaro/VariationalMC.jl) package.

## Output Data Folder Structure

Each simulation performed with [VariationalMC.jl](https://github.com/atanjaro/VariationalMC.jl) will generate a directory
with a user defined name that all the output of the simulation will be written to, which will be referred to as `datafolder` here. 
Inside the `datafolder` a set of files and folders resembling the structure outlined below will be found:

- `[datafolder]`: 
  - `model_summary.toml`: A TOML file that describes qunatities that were used in the simulation.
  - `[correlation]`: Directory containing all files pertaining to correlation measurements made during the simulation.
    - `opt_bin_measurements.h5`: HDF5 file containing binned measurements made during the optimization step.
    - `sim_bin_measurements.h5`: HDF5 file containing binned measurements made during the simulation step.
    - `den-den_correlation_stats.csv`
    - `spn-spn_correlation_states.csv`
  - `[optimization]`: Directory containing all file pertaining to measurements used during the optimization step.
    - `opt_bin_measurements.h5`: HDF5 file containing binned measurements made during the optimization step.
    - `e-den-den_jastrow_parameters.csv`
    - `parameter_cdw_stats.csv`
    - `parameter_csd_stats.csv`
    - `parameter_ssd_stats.csv`
    - `parameter_sx_stats.csv`
    - `parameter_msz_stats.csv`
    - `parameter_mu_stats.csv`
  - `[simulation]`: Directory containing all files pertaining to measured observables made during the simulation. 
    - `opt_bin_measurements.h5`: HDF5 file containing binned measurements made during the optimization step.
    - `sim_bin_measurements.h5`: HDF5 file containing binned measurements made during the simulation step.
    - `bin_measurements.h5`: merged HDF5 file containing all binned measurments made during the simulation.
    - `double_occ_stats.csv`
    - `global_density_stats.csv`
    - `local_energy_stats.csv`
    - `pconfig_stats.csv`
